# FormData

This chapter is about sending HTML forms: with or without files, with additional fields and so on. [FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects can help with that.

The constructor is:
```js
let formData = new FormData([form]);
```

If HTML `form` element is provided, it automatically captures its fields.

Network methods, such as `fetch` accept `FormData` objects as a body. They are  encoded and sent out with `Content-Type: form/multipart`.

So, from the server point of view, that looks like a usual form submission.

## Sending a simple form

Let's send a simple form first.

As you can see, that's almost one-liner:

```html run autorun
<form id="formElem">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="John">
  <input type="text" name="surname" value="Smith">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<script>
  formElem.onsubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/user', {
      method: 'POST',
*!*
      body: new FormData(formElem)
*/!*
    });

    let result = await response.json();

    alert(result.message);
  };
</script>
```

Here, the server accepts the POST request with the form and replies "User saved".

## FormData Methods

We can modify fields in `FormData` with methods:

- `formData.append(name, value)` - add a form field with the given `name` and `value`,
- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)` - add a field as if it were `<input type="file">`, the third argument `fileName` sets file name (not form field name), as it it were a name of the file in user's filesystem,
- `formData.delete(name)` - remove the field with the given `name`,
- `formData.get(name)` - get the value of the field with the given `name`,
- `formData.has(name)` - if there exists a field with the given `name`, returns `true`, otherwise `false`

A form is technically allowed to have many fields with the same `name`, so multiple calls to `append` add more same-named fields.

There's also method `set`, with the same syntax as `append`. The difference is that `.set` removes all fields with the given `name`, and then appends a new field. So it makes sure there's only field with such `name`:

- `formData.set(name, value)`,
- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`.


Also we can iterate over formData fields using `for..of` loop:

```js run
let formData = new FormData();
formData.append('key1', 'value1');
formData.append('key2', 'value2');

// List key/value pairs
for(let [name, value] of formData) {
  alert(`${name} = ${value}`); // key1=value1, then key2=value2
}
```

## Sending a form with a file

The form is always sent as `Content-Type: form/multipart`. So, `<input type="file">` fields are sent also, similar to a usual form submission.

Here's an example with such form:

```html run autorun
<form id="formElem">
  <input type="text" name="firstName" value="John">
  Picture: <input type="file" name="picture" accept="image/*">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<script>
  formElem.onsubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/user-avatar', {
      method: 'POST',
*!*
      body: new FormData(formElem)
*/!*
    });

    let result = await response.json();

    alert(result.message);
  };
</script>
```

## Sending a form with blob

As we've seen in the chapter <info:fetch>, sending a dynamically generated `Blob`, e.g. an image, is easy. We can supply it directly as `fetch` body.

In practice though, it's often more convenient to send an image as a part of the form, with additional fields, such as "name" and other metadata.

Also, servers are usually more suited to accept multipart-encoded forms, rather than raw binary data.

This example submits an image from `<canvas>`, along with some other fields, using `FormData`:

```html run autorun height="90"
<body style="margin:0">
  <canvas id="canvasElem" width="100" height="80" style="border:1px solid"></canvas>

  <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="submit()">

  <script>
    canvasElem.onmousemove = function(e) {
      let ctx = canvasElem.getContext('2d');
      ctx.lineTo(e.clientX, e.clientY);
      ctx.stroke();
    };

    async function submit() {
      let imageBlob = await new Promise(resolve => canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, 'image/png'));

*!*
      let formData = new FormData();
      formData.append("firstName", "John");
      formData.append("image", imageBlob, "image.png");
*/!*    

      let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/image-form', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
      });
      let result = await response.json();
      alert(result.message);
    }

  </script>
</body>
```

Please note how the image `Blob` is added:

```js
formData.append("image", imageBlob, "image.png");
```

That's same as if there were `<input type="file" name="image">` in the form, and the visitor submitted a file `image.png` from their filesystem.

## Summary

[FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects are used to read HTML form and submit it using `fetch` or another network method.

We can either create `new FormData(form)` from an HTML form, or create an empty object, and then append fields with methods:

- `formData.append(name, value)`
- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)`
- `formData.set(name, value)`
- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`

Two peculiarities here:
1. The `set` method removes fields with the same name, `append` doesn't.
2. To send a file, 3-argument syntax is needed, the last argument is a file name, that normally is taken from user filesystem for `<input type="file">`.

Other methods are:

- `formData.delete(name)`
- `formData.get(name)`
- `formData.has(name)`

That's it!
